### Why do Banks need Retail Deposits?

* Cheapness
  * Retail deposits pay little or no interest
* Stickiness
  * Retail deposits are kept by people who are relatively insensitive to interest rates, and are unlikely to remove funds for a small difference in interest paid by a competitor
* Regulation
  * Liquidity requirements in almost every country give banks the incentive to develop large retail deposit bases
* Insurance
  * Most countries' governments insure retail bank deposits so the depositors do not have to make a credit decision when placing funds with a regulated bank

  * Net Income Margin = (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue
* Non-performing Loans / Total Loans
  * A loan in which the borrower is default and hasn't made any scheduled payments of principal or interest for some time
* Total Capital Ratio
* Dividend per Share (DPS)

### Value-at-Risk
A risk management technique that measures and quantifies the level of financial risk within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame.

Volatility is calculated as:
>Volatility_daily = Volatility_annual /  sqrt(252)

>Volatility_n-day = Volatility_m-day /  sqrt(252/n)

VaR = Portfolio x Standard Deviation x Volatility

Given that we hold a $10mm position in a single stock and its volatility is 16% annually.

What is the 99% 1-day Var? What if the time horizon is extended to 5-days?

Volatility_daily = 0.16 / sqrt(252)
VaR = $10mm * 2.326 * Volatility_daily

### Expected Loss
Loss on a capital market trade:
>Expected loss = Exposure at default x Probability of default x Loss given default

Qns. Consider one of Jane's contracts with the client
* 30,000 ABC stock at $25 ps from the client - value
* Delivery in 2 years' time
* Current market-to-market gain is $40,000
* Probability of default is estimated to be 70%
* Recovery Value is estimated to be 25%
  
What is her expected loss?

Ans.
> $40,000 * 0.7 * 0.75
