## Annual cashflow of bonds
Bond valuation includes calculating the present value of a bond's future interest payments, also known as its cash flow, and the bond's value upon maturity, also known as its face value or par value.

## Yield curve
Where does this come from?  Very simple: choose a collection of comparable bonds (e.g. all government bonds by the same issuer, all senior IBM bonds, etc.) and plot their yields versus their maturities.

Empirical studies have shown that on average over time yield curves tend to be upward sloping.  The diagram above is the sort of “classic” shape you might see in a theoretical text book.  The next two slides show real world conditions – not always perfectly-shaped upward sloping concave curves, but not wildly different from that either

## Duration (not calculation)
Macaulay Duration
>the weighted average term to maturity of the cash flows from a bond
>Longer -> more rate sensitivity (analogous to beta in equities, how volatile is the bond’s price when its yield moves?):

This balancing point (in terms of years) is a measurement of so-called DURATION.  The larger the DURATION of a bond, the more sensitive its price will be to a change in interest rates.

Modified Duration
> More useful risk metric: how much the bond price moves for a 1% change in yield (approximately)


## Investment grade

## Difference between securities and loans

## Difference between bonds and equity

Equity can be “private” or “public”
* Private shareholders are sometimes restricted from selling on to others
* Public shares are shares “listed” on a public exchange where any qualifying investor can buy or sell

Equity holding can be “majority” or “minor”
* “Majority” means shareholder owns more than 50% of the shares
* “Minority” means less than 50%
* Own majority if you want to control the company
* Own minority if you only want to participate in performance of the company

Equity investors are called “shareholders” because they own a share in the company

Reasons why PE might be higher lower:
Expectation of growth – higher PE implies higher expectation of growth
Regional “norm” – some markets trade higher than other markets

A bond sets out timings:
* When interest/coupon payments will be paid – namely the  “coupon payment date”
* When the debt principal or the “face value” is due i.e. “matures”

A Bond sets out cash flows:
* Size of the interest payments, or the “coupon”, may be amount or % of face
* Amount of debt per bond holder i.e. “face value” of the bond
* Illustrated bond is $5 bond with $0.075 coupon
* Public bonds are those freely tradeable – listed on exchange and network of market makers
* Private bonds are arranged by investment banks for one/small group of creditors who are restricted in selling the bond on


## Difference between exchange and otc
Over-the-counter (OTC) or off-exchange trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating liquidity, providing transparency, and maintaining the current market price.

Exchange:

| Pros | Cons
| -------- | -----------
| Liquid market | No counterparty no trade
| Transparent commision/trading fee | Standardised contracts
| Transparent pricing |

## Derivates are securities, Physical commodities and FX are not securities

## NOTES FROM OTHERS
1. REIT investors earn dividends, NOT rental yield or coupons.
2. If Interest Rates FALL (so you require a LOWER return than the coupon rate) then the bond will be worth more than the par, and if rates RISE (you require a HIGHER return that the coupon rate) then the bond will be worth LESS than the par.
3. Fair Value = Arbitrage Free Price
  - What do we call it when the futures price > spot price? Contango.
  - The opposite is backwardation. When would an equity futures price be backwardated? Negative Outlook.
5. Pricing Swaps - PV of fixed leg must equal PV of floating leg, at inception.
6. Forward rate is the best estimate.
