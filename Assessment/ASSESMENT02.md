### Cognitive Errors due to Mental "Short Cuts".
Many of our human behaviours are caused by **hueristic biases**.

**Hueristics = mental shortcuts** = rules-of-thumb used to solve complex problems.

Hueristics can be powerful problem-solving tools, but when used in the wrong situation, reliance on heuristics can be lead to systematic mistakes, biased forecasts and mispriced securities.

### Anchoring
>Anchoring is a cognitive error.

It starts with a high price and "working down"

### Diversification
Diversification is **increasing assets which are negatively co-vary or have negative correlations to each other.**

Make sure you can get the expected return calculation
| Scenario | Probability | Return |
| -------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 1        | 10%         | -10%   |
| 2        | 30%         | 0%     |
| 3        | 40%         | 10%    |
| 4        | 20%         | 25%    |

Ans. (0.1 x -10) + (0.3 x 0) + (0.4 x 10) + (0.2 x 25) = 8%

### Efficient Frontier
Set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expcted return.

### Sub-optimal:
Everything underneath the efficient frontier at that level of risk are considered sub-optimal for that particular portfolio.

### Risk Portfolio Diversification
Unsystematic risk is the risk attribute to factors unique to an asset.

Systematic risk is the minimum level of risk that can be obtained for a portfolio by means of diversifaction.

>More diversity reduces unsystematic risk.

>You're unable to get rid of unsystematic risk no matter what, only able to reduce it.
