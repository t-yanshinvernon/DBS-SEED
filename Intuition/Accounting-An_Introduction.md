# Accounting

## Introduction
Accounting is the process of **identifying**, **recording**, and **reporting** financial information about a particular entity to interested parties. The communication of financial information is through *financial statements*, such as *balance sheet* and *income statement*.

*Financial accounting* is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company.

## Generating & Using Accounting Information
### Producing FInancial Statements
A company's financial accountants are tasked with producing **statutory financial statements**.
>Financial statements that are required to be filed under the local laws and reuglation

A company's accounts must be generally be independently verified by the company's registered auditors.
> They do not make changes to the accounts and are responsible only for providing an opinion about whether the accounts are accurate and show an unbiased view of the state of the company's finance.

### Key Users of Financial Statements
* Management & Employees
* Customers
* Suppliers
* Lenders
* Shareholders/Investors
* Government Agencies
* Analysts
* Competitors

### Conflicts of Interest
Different users of financial statements have different needs and objectives.
Some examples are:
* Suppliers and prospective investors
  * Financial statements that aim to provide a **full and as fair disclosure** of the state of the organization as possible.
* Organization
  * Financial statements that aim to **maximize the wealtth of its stockholders**, so the stockholders would naturally prefer financial statements that **result in the highest possible stock price**.
* Management
  * Financial statements that aim to paint the organization in a flattering light, minimize the cost of capital to the organization.

### Earnings management
Also known as *Creative Accounting*, is the transformation of financial accounting numbers from what they actually are to what the company management preparing a financial report desires.

It is not usually illegal or fraudulent in nature but is generally used to portray a healthier picture of an entity's financial position and/or performance
> The motives behind it are to meet internal or external targets or expectations, or to smooth earnings over time (boost company's share price).

### Earnings management: Examples
* Choice of Accounting Methods
* Estimation/Valuation
  * Provides ample scope for manipulation of the value and armotization period for the asset.
  * >Amortization: an accounting technique used to periodically lower the book value of a loan or intangible asset over a set period of time.
* Timing of Transactions
  * Revenues and expenses occurring toward the end of an accounting period or the start of the next one may be delayed or expedited so that they are recognized in the desired accounting period.
* Once-Off Restructuring Charges
  * Overstates restructuring charges because investors may look beyond these one-off charges and focus on future cash flow.
* Manipulating Reserves
  * "Bumped up" in highly profitable periods and reduced in leaner periods.

### Detecting Earnings Management
Here are some classic signs that earnings management may be taking place:
* Cash Flow Lags Revenue
* Inadequate Bad Debt Provisions
* Creation of Reserves
* Acquisition Reserves
* Consistent Earnings

## Financial Statements
A company's financial statements summarize the measurements of the company's financial performance and position.
Its key financial statements are:
* Balance sheet
* Statement of retained earnings
* Income statement
* Statement of cash flows

### Balance Sheet
A list of a company's assets, and claims against those assets. Helps to provide a picture of the **company's financial position at a specific point in time**.

There are three key elements of the balance sheet:
* Assets
  * Economic resource controlled by the company from which it expects to derive economic benefits in the future.
    * Noncurrent assets
      * **Life of more than one year**.
    * Current assets
      * Cash and any other asset that the company will turn into **cash within one year**.
    * Intangible assets
      * Assets **without a physical substance** and include **goodwill**, patents, trademarks, and copyrights.
* Liabilities
  * Obligation of the company.
    * Current Liabilities
      * **Life of up to one year** (e.g. accounts payable and overdrafts).
    * Long-term liabilities
      * **Maturity of more than one year** (e.g. long-term loan).
* Equity
  * **The difference between its assets and its liabilities.**
  * Therefore, **Assets = Equity + Liabilities**.

### Statement of Retained Earnings
Details the change in stockholders' equity over an accounting period.

The change comprises in the following elements:
* Net income during the accounting period attributable to shareholders
* Share capital issued or repaid during the period
* Dividend payments to shareholders
* Gains and losses recognized directly in equity
* Effect of changes ina ccounting policies or correction of accounting error

### Income Statement
Summarizes a company's income for the year and expenditure over the accounting period.
Here are the key elements of the income statement:
* Revenue
  * Income generated by selling its products and or services.
* Expenses
  * Costs assosciated with running the business and can be split into:
    * Operating expenses (i.e. salaries, electricity).
    * Non-operating expenses (i.e. currency exchange, interest).
* Gains & Losses
  * Increase or decrease in equity resulting from a transaction.
* Net Income
  * Represents the profit after all expenses have been deducted and is added to the retained earnings, increasing the equity.

### Statement of Cash Flows
Reports changes in cash and cash equivalents during a time period.

Helps to inform the company if it actually generated cash and if it has enough cash on hand to pay its expenses and purchase assets.

we can break down changes into three different categories:

* Operating Activities
  * Main revenue-producing activities of the entity.
* Investing Activities
  * Acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments that are not considered to be cash equivalents.
* Financing Activites
  * Activities that will alter the equity or borrowings of a business.

### Double Entry Accounting
This is a system where every transaction has two entries in a company's general ledge - a debit and a credit.

Debit entries:
* Increase in assets
* Increase in expense
* Decrease in liability
* Decrease in equity
* Decrease in income

Credit entries:
* Decrease in assets
* Decrease in expense
* Decrease in liability
* Increase in equity
* Increase in income

### Double Entry Accounting: Accounting Equation

>Assets - Liabilities = Equity

Which can also be expressed as:

>Assets = Equity + Liabilities

  * Requires revenues and costs to be recorded in the accounting period in which they are earned or inccured, rather than when money is received or paid.
