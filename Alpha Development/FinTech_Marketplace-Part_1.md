## Lending
### Marketplace (Peer-to-peer #P2P)

Lending Process:
>Online Application -> Scoring System -> Advertising of Loan -> Institutional/Personal Lender -> Origination Fees

 Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending enables individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as the middleman. Websites that facilitate P2P lending have greatly increased its adoption as an alternative method of financing.

>P2P lending is also known as “social lending” or “crowd lending.” 

### Credit Scoring

Traditional credit scoring is based on a viarity of information sources - e.g. FICO scores:
* Payment history
* Accounts owed
* Length of credit history
* Credit mix (variety of accounts)
* New credit (recently opened accounts)

More recent innovations in the field are exploring the use of other data:
* Social network (behavorial) data
* Mobile phone records
* Various startups are specialised in providing new forms of ratings based on big data techniques

Credit score is an indication of a borrower's probability of default

Common approach is to use a scorecard mode, involving logistic regression

### Alternative Data in Consumer Credit

Particularly useful for consumers with 'thin' credit files.

Examples:
* Rental payment history
* Mobile call patterns, locations, bill payments
* Online Social Footprint
